investigations:
  - id: protocol
    name: "Protocol Analysis"
    questions:
      - "What is MCP and how does it work technically?"
      - "What are the key protocol primitives (tools, resources, prompts)?"
      - "How does it compare to alternatives like A2A?"
    instructions: >
      Reference the official MCP specification directly.
      Include protocol version and transport details.

  - id: servers
    name: "Server Ecosystem"
    questions:
      - "What MCP servers exist and what do they do?"
      - "Which have the most adoption? (GitHub stars, mentions)"
      - "What categories of servers are missing?"
    instructions: >
      Check the official MCP server registry and GitHub.
      Create a categorized table of existing servers.

  - id: adoption
    name: "Client Adoption"
    questions:
      - "Which AI tools support MCP as a client?"
      - "What is the user experience like in each client?"
      - "What limitations do current clients have?"
    instructions: >
      Check Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and other known
      MCP clients. Note version requirements and setup friction.
