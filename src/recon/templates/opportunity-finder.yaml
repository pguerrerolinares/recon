  - id: gaps
    name: "Ecosystem Gaps"
    questions:
      - "What problems in this space are unsolved or poorly solved?"
      - "What do users/developers consistently complain about?"
      - "What workarounds are people using for missing features?"
      - "What GitHub issues have the most thumbs-up but remain open?"
    instructions: >
      Search GitHub issues, Reddit, Hacker News, Stack Overflow.
      Quote actual users. Quantify pain (number of upvotes, frequency
      of complaints). Focus on gaps with real demand signals.

  - id: ideas
    name: "Project Ideas"
    questions:
      - "What specific products or tools could fill the identified gaps?"
      - "What are at least 10 concrete project ideas with descriptions?"
      - "For each idea, what is the approximate effort level?"
      - "What existing projects attempted something similar and why did they fail?"
    instructions: >
      For each idea, check if something similar already exists.
      If it does, explain why it's insufficient. Be specific about
      the value proposition of each idea. Estimate scope (weekend
      project, month, quarter).

  - id: viability
    name: "Viability Assessment"
    questions:
      - "Which ideas have the largest addressable market?"
      - "Which are feasible for a solo developer or small team?"
      - "What monetization options exist for each?"
      - "What are the key risks and dependencies?"
    instructions: >
      Use verified data for market sizing where possible.
      Check for existing competition and barriers to entry.
      Assess technical feasibility honestly. Mark assumptions
      as [ASSUMPTION].

  - id: demand
    name: "Demand Signals"
    questions:
      - "What search volume or trend data exists for these topics?"
      - "What are people willing to pay for? (check existing pricing)"
      - "What free tools have high adoption? (potential freemium conversion)"
      - "What job postings mention these technologies?"
    instructions: >
      Check Google Trends where possible. Look for pricing pages
      of related products. Check job boards for demand signals.
      Distinguish between developer interest and business demand.

  - id: playbook
    name: "Execution Playbook"
    questions:
      - "What are the fastest paths to a working MVP for the top ideas?"
      - "What tech stacks are recommended for each?"
      - "What distribution channels work for this type of product?"
      - "What are the first 3 steps for each top idea?"
    instructions: >
      Be concrete and actionable. Include specific tool
      recommendations with reasoning. Reference successful
      launches of similar projects for distribution strategy.

  instructions: >
    Rank all identified opportunities using a scoring matrix with
    criteria: market size, feasibility, competition level, monetization

    plans with week-by-week milestones. Include a "what NOT to build"
    section with reasoning.
