investigations:
  - id: frameworks
    name: "Frameworks and Tools"
    questions:
      - "What are the major frameworks/tools in this space?"
      - "What is the adoption level of each? (GitHub stars, downloads, usage)"
      - "What are the key architectural differences between them?"
      - "Which are actively maintained vs stagnating?"
    instructions: >
      Check GitHub repos directly for stars, recent commits, issue counts.
      Check PyPI/npm download stats where applicable.
      Create a comparison table with quantitative metrics.

  - id: architecture
    name: "Architecture Patterns"
    questions:
      - "What are the dominant architecture patterns?"
      - "What are the trade-offs of each approach?"
      - "What patterns are emerging as best practices?"
      - "What anti-patterns have been identified by the community?"
    instructions: >
      Reference official documentation and architecture guides.
      Include diagrams descriptions where helpful.
      Cite specific technical blog posts and conference talks.

  - id: standards
    name: "Standards and Protocols"
    questions:
      - "What standards and protocols are relevant?"
      - "What is the adoption status of each standard?"
      - "Are there competing standards? Which is winning?"
      - "What interoperability challenges exist?"
    instructions: >
      Check official standard specifications and RFCs.
      Note which major players support which standards.
      Assess maturity level (draft, adopted, widespread).

  - id: ecosystem
    name: "Ecosystem and Integrations"
    questions:
      - "What does the broader ecosystem look like?"
      - "What integrations and plugins are available?"
      - "What are the key infrastructure dependencies?"
      - "What hosting/deployment options exist?"
    instructions: >
      Map the ecosystem relationships. Note which tools work
      well together and which have integration friction.
      Check marketplace/registry listings where applicable.

  - id: future
    name: "Future Directions"
    questions:
      - "What are the announced roadmaps of major players?"
      - "What research papers are influencing the field?"
      - "What shifts are likely in the next 12-24 months?"
      - "What are the current limitations that are actively being worked on?"
    instructions: >
      Check official roadmaps, blog posts, and conference announcements.
      Distinguish between confirmed plans and speculation.
      Mark predictions as [PREDICTION] vs confirmed roadmap items.

synthesis:
  instructions: >
    Map the technology landscape visually (describe the map in text).
    Identify the most mature vs emerging technologies. Provide a
    decision framework for choosing between alternatives based on
    use case, team size, and constraints. Include a "technology radar"
    categorization (adopt, trial, assess, hold).
